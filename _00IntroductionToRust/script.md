# Alright. First of all, what is Rust ? 
Rust is a System Programming Language like C and C++ used for  building operating systems or game engines.
Which means that it is a compiled programming language.
 
It has started as a side project by Graydon Hoare in 2007  who named it after the rust fungus and then it was sponsored by mozilla in 2009 , but the first version of Rust has appeared in 2014.

For some reason, Rust has been the most admired language for 7 consecutive year according to stack overflow developers survey.

https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#:~:text=Rust%20is%20the%20most%20admired,use%20it%20again%20next%20year.

Those who get the opportunity to use rust have fallen in love with it and 86.1 percent of 65000 developers rated
rust as the most loved programming language since 2016. 

Some of the biggest companies in the world are using Rust like Dropbox, Discord, Amazon, Mozilla, Go, Facebook, and Microsoft.

What is the secret behind Rust ? Why developers love it and companies prefer it over other languages such as C and C++ ?
Even the White House suggested that companies must switch from C and C++ to Rust - that was a few month ago in February!

It turned out that the reasons behind that love to Rust - and remember that Rust is a systems programming language like C and C++ - and what it tries to do is very hard actually .. it tries tof ind a balance between Speed, Safety, Cocnurrency and Portability.

1So Rust is fairly comparable to C and C++ in terms of speed.

2Most of the low level languages like C is very fast compilling to machine code in no time, because it's very close to the hardware, to your metal, also not safe - and I am going to talk alot about safety throughout this course.

3It is concurrent, which means multi threads can run in parallel if you desicded to design your application this way, sure there are bugs like data races, and dangling reference errors [ which I will explain in details both thos bugs], but there are way to avoid them before compilation.

4Finally portable, you compile once and run everywhere, whether windows linux or mac, it compiles your code to an executable file which is portable on any system.

* one of the most distinctive features about Rust is its memory efficiency techniques.

- high-level languages like python provides garbage collection for better memory management control [don't worry about those terms, I am going to explain that in details when we reach the ownership chapter of this course] 

- lower-level languages like c provide functions for memory allocation.

- Rust does not have garbage collector instead it uses
concept called ownership and borrowing 

Rust also has a package manager called cargo
and cargo is similar to npm for Node or pip for Python
python 

Install Rust.
Create a file and run hello world
Create a project and run it.
